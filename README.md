**Junior Cybersecurity Analyst | Vulnerability Management | Threat Hunting | Security Operations**

I am an early-career cybersecurity analyst focused on vulnerability management, threat hunting, and compliance-aligned security operations. I build hands-on, evidence-driven security projects that demonstrate my ability to investigate alerts, document findings, validate vulnerabilities, and support real-world security workflows. My background includes cybersecurity training, hands-on lab environments, and software engineering apprenticeship experience where I developed foundational web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
